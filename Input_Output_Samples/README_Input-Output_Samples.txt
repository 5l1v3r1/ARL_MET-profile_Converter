The input samples are fairly typical.  These input and output samples were taken from a series of comparisons of model output profiles with co-incident radiosonde observation (RAOB) soundings.  The file names help identify the location and date/time of the input and output.  Extensions to the output names indicate the types of output within each of the files. No extension in the input file name after the date/time indicates a RAOB.  In these samples, the extension for hour and horizontal grid spacing indicates a WRF derived sounding.  

The temporal and spatial resolutions shown relate to the input from the large scale model (e.g. GFS) used for initialization.  For example, 3h_0p50 means the large scale model data were produced every 3h and had a horizontal grid spacing of 0.50 degrees (latitude and longitude).  Since the user provides the input file name it can have other information in the extension.  However, it should have something (e.g. _WRF) to distinguish it from the co-incident RAOB (or the RAOB could have an extension such as _RAOB).  

TOP is the standard identifier for Topeka, Kansas, USA and FGZ identifies Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.  TOP_2015121500 is a RAOB obtained at the U of Wyoming weather web site (www.weather.uwyo.edu) for 00 UTC on 15 December 2015.  FGZ_NOAA_2016062100 is a RAOB extracted from the NOAA archive (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/raobs/).  With minor modification of the input routine the program can work with 2-second and 10-second radiosonde data as done in earlier versions.   TOP_2015121500_3h_0p50 is a "sounding" extracted from WRF output where the large scale model for initialzation had temporal and spatial spacing of 3h and 0.50 degrees.  

The extensions USRLVL and USRMSG refer to level and layer output, and the additional extension P indicates the output is for pressure levels or layers rather than for height.
